# Best Ball Majors

This is the backend for the Best Ball Majors website.

Best Ball Majors is a fantasy golf website which allows users to view live PGA scores, create weekly rosters, and join leagues with friends.

The backend is made with NodeJS. It includes a REST API, as well as a script for scraping live scores from ESPN. The web scraping is done with Puppeteer.

This backend was originally deployed to an AWS EC2 with a MySQL database. That EC2 is not currently running, but the frontend can still be viewed.
